This site documents my journey into exploring animating musical composition with directed graphs. 

I was been a professional musician (20 years) for twice as long as a data scientist (10 years), but never married the two passions before. 

# Project plan

## Hello Bach

Animate the subject of Contropunctus I using `ggraph` and `gganimate`.

Each node will be a note, and each edge represents a sequence of two notes. The animation will add edges to the nodes as sequences cumulate. 

## Proof of concept

Animate Contrapunctus I in R, prerendered.

## Animation with DOTS in Unity

Animate Contrpunctus I in Unity, prerendered.

## Live music animation

For live music, I suspect I will have rendering issues using R and midi files. 

The bluesky plan is to adapt my proof of concept to C# and Unity, connect midi keyboards, and develop software to provide live animations of my algorithmic compositions.
