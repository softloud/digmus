Bach’s Contrapunctus I as a directed graph using ggraph.\nThe biggest learning curve here is going to be the data export of music; I’m exploring how to produce live animation, but need to break this into a series of small, achievable objectives. The live component will come last, to begin with I need to figure out how to export the data from what I play into something I can understand as data.\nAnother quite separate hurdle is to explore expanding my compositions from acoustic to production-infused neoclassical I’ve always heard in my head. To get started, however, I will use Bach for developing my animation ideas."
